[[!meta description=""]]

A friend sent me an newspaper article by
[Jeff Guo](http://www.washingtonpost.com/people/jeff-guo)
called "[Want proof college is worth it? Look at this list of the highest-paying majors](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/storyline/wp/2014/09/29/want-proof-college-is-worth-it-look-at-this-list-of-the-highest-paying-majors/)",
and that article discusses an article by 
[Brad Hershbein](http://www.hamiltonproject.org/about_us/our_people/brad_hershbein/)
and [Melissa S. Kearney](http://www.hamiltonproject.org/about_us/our_people/melissa_s._kearney/)
called "[Major Decisions: What Graduates Earn Over Their Lifetimes](http://www.hamiltonproject.org/papers/major_decisions_what_graduates_earn_over_their_lifetimes/)".
While the first of these articles makes so much hype about how going to college
is a good idea financially, the second article isn't really about that. (It
only looks at how much money people make.)
So I wanted to take a look at whether going to college is a good idea in
financial terms.

## Assessments of the financial value of college from these articles
Brad and Melissa's article doesn't discuss whether
people who go to college are likely to make more money in the long run,
but they do say some things that are related.

Brad and Melissa discuss how much money people earn across their lifetimes and
how it relates to the major they had in college.

> Over the entire working life, the typical college graduate will earn $1.19
> million in todayâ€™s dollars [2].  This is more than twice as much as the
> lifetime earnings of a typical high school graduate ($580,000), and $335,000
> more than that of a typical associate degree graduate. Figure 2 shows median
> lifetime earnings for select majors, including those with the highest
> earnings, those with the lowest earnings, and those that are among the most
> common. As can be seen in the figure, lifetime earnings vary widely across
> majors. Over the entire career, the highest-earning majors will earn about
> two-and-a-half times what the lowest-earning majors will earn, a range from
> over $2 million for some engineering majors to about $800,000 for early
> childhood education. 

Jeff summarizes this as follows.

> The researchers estimate that even when college costs are taken into
> account, the median early childhood education major still makes 10 percent
> to 15 percent more than the median American with just a high school degree.

That is, people who went to college make more money. But does it make up
for tuition?
Brad and Melissa briefly considered tuition costs.

> Even if [$102,000] were subtracted from career earnings, it would still be
> the case that median net lifetime earnings in every major would exceed those
> of the median high school graduate. 

They use this $102,000 figure because
[another Hamilton Project article](http://www.hamiltonproject.org/files/downloads_and_links/06_college_value.pdf),
by [Adam Looney](http://www.hamiltonproject.org/about_us/our_people/adam_looney/)
and [Michael Greenstone](http://www.hamiltonproject.org/about_us/our_people/michael_greenstone/)
estimated the average cost of a college degree to be $102,000.
By adjusting in this manner, Brad and Melissa account for inflation but not
for the other investments that you could make with your tuition money.

Adam and Michael spend longer considering whether a college degree makes money
and concluded that it does. More precisely, they conclude that it is a better
investment than the stock market, corporate bonds, gold, &c. On the other hand,
they don't consider the details of lifetime earnings. (Presumably, that is part
of why Brad and Melissa did their study.)

## Relating tuition and earnings in more detail
Brad and Melissa have much detail on earnings and little detail on tuition.
Oppositely, Adam and Michael have little detail on earnings and much detail
on tuition. Let's consider both earnings and tuition. In order to be so
detailed and still finish this in time to have lunch, however, I'm going to
make you collect the empirical data.

### Three (really two) investment choices
Because they adjusted for inflation, we can think of Brad and Melissa's
lifetime earnings figures as lump sums of money that you
recieve when you stop working. Because you probably spent all of your
college money within a few years (rather than across a lifetime), let's
think of that as money that you invest when you are 20 and get some
yearly return on.

#### College and work
One thing you might do with this money is purchase a college education
and then work afterwards. Brad and Melissa estimated how much money you
might earn if you do this

#### Not college and retire
Can you retire on a college tuition? Let's see.
We'll assume that you make absolutely no money if you don't go to college.
(You probably would make some money, but I'll talk about that later.)
Instead of going to college, you withdraw money every year to pay for your
living expenses.

For example, let's figure that you have saved up $100,000. Instead of going
to college, you withdraw $15,000 (15%) the first year. Because of inflation,
you have to withdraw more each year (Let's say 2.5% more).

My choice of withdrawing 15% is a very conservative estimate.

First, this is a high withdrawal rate, and you will run out of money before
you get to 65; if you withdrew something closer to 7%, you not run out of
money and would wind up earning more money in total.

Second, this might be equivalent to a higher salary than you think.
The money you have saved has already been taxed, so a withdrawal of $15,000
might be much better than a salary of $15,000. I don't know tax rules
very well, however, so I'm not sure.

### Not college and work
Perhaps you don't go to college and instead start working right away.
Like the previous option, you don't spend your money on college, but
instead of spending the money on living expenses, you work a job to
cover your living expenses.

You work until you are 65 and earn what a typical person who hasn't
gone to college earns: A median lifetime earnings of $580,000 within
that period, or $13,000 per year if you work for 45 years.
(These are present-day figures,
so both would really increase over your life.)

You decide not to touch your college savings until you retire. That is,
you neither deposit nor withdraw any money into your savings account until
you are 65; you spend your entire $13,000 salary on living expenses.

### Which investment?
I just proposed three (really just two) things you might do with your
college fund. Which makes sense?

Imagine that you are concerned only about money and that you have decided
to invest a certain amount of money (Call it "college tuition", even though
it includes your housing and food and whatnot.) when you are 20. You may
choose between two purchases: college or the stock market. Which one should
you choose?

I have drawn the plot below to help you with that.

<img alt="Predicted return on college and stock market investments"
     src="general-predictions.png"
     class="wide" />

The *x* axis is the amount of money that you invest; you invest it either
in college or the stock market. The *y* axis is the amount of money that
you expect to get back from the investment.

The slanted lines are for if you invest in the stock market.
The green lines are for if you work a low-paying job too, and the
yellow lines are for if you retire right after college.
The lines are slanted
because you'll make more money if you start with more money.

The stock market lines include the initial savings as money earned.
This is a bit weird, but it makes the results correspond better to the
college investment. Think of it like this: You can either go to college
and earn money at a higher rate or not go to college, get a head start
on your earnings, and earn money at a lower rate.

The three horizontal lines are for if you go to college. The three lines
correspond to two different college majors (early childhood education and
engineering) and to the median-earning college major. The lines are
flat because Brad and Melissa's paper does not relate college expenses to
lifetime earnings; their paper says that people who go to college make
more money, but it does not say that people who spend more money on college
make more money.

### Calculating your costs
Brad and Melissa converted earnings figures into
[2014 dollars](http://www.hamiltonproject.org/files/downloads_and_links/MajorDecisions-TechnicalAppendix2.pdf).
If you are going to college or went to college recently, you can consider that
the value of the dollars you spent on college is approximately the same as it
would have been in 2014. If not, adjust the tuition for that. (Multiply your actual tuition cost by 1.02, *n* times, where *n* is the difference between 2014 and the year you paid the money)

If you took out loans, estimate the total interest that you will pay. If you
expect that it will take more than like five years to pay back all the loans,
adjust for inflation. (Divide each loan payment by 1.02 *n* times, where n is the number of years between when you received the money and when you paid back the money.)

You can decide whether to consider just your college tuition or the sum of
your tuition, housing, food, &c.

### Your earnings
Figure out how much you are earning, guess how much you are going to earn,
and/or look up in Brad and Melissa's paper how much your major is expected
to earn.

### An example
Let's use me as an example, because I'm curious about what I'll find.

I spent $100,000 on college.

<img alt="Tom spent $100,000 on college."
     src="tom-expenses.png"
     class="wide" />

I didn't see "ergonomics" in Brad and Melissa's paper, and the only "design"
is "graphic design", so let's say that I'm "multidisciplinary science".

<img alt="We predict that Tom will earn $1.15 million through his life."
     src="tom-predictions.png"
     class="wide" />

I just drew lines for my expenses and predict earnings; this point is
their intersection.

<img alt="Tom's college expenses and his predicted lifetime earnings"
     src="tom-both.png"
     class="wide" />

Now let's put that pink dot on top of the first plot I drew.

<img alt="How Tom's investment compares to alternatives"
     src="tom-comparison.png"
     class="wide" />

It looks like my situation was quite typical.
I spent about $100,000 on college,
and Adam and Michael found $102,000 to be the average expense.
Multidisciplinary science majors earn on median
[$1.19 million](http://www.hamiltonproject.org/files/downloads_and_links/FINAL_MajorDecisions-Appendix_Table_2.pdf) over a lifetime,
and this is also the median across all majors.

If I had decided to retire right after high school and I plan poorly
(that is, I withdraw $15,000, plus inflation, every year),
I my plot says I would have earned as much by not going to college as
I will by going to college. And if I plan better (that is, spend less
than $15,000 plus inflation per year), I'll earn even more money.

Recall that this calculation assumes that I make **no money** if I don't go
to college. That is, it does not consider that people with high school degrees
and no college degree make $580,000 on median.
In my situation, instead of going to college and then working, I could have
invested $100,000 in the stock market, [retired](/!/sleeping),
and earned nearly as much money through my investment as a typical college
graduate earns in total.

Now let's consider what happens if I *do* work. If the stock market does
very poorly, I'll earn about as much as if I don't work. But if the stock
market performs more typically, I could have expected more than twice the
earnings!

### The usual problems with simplifying things
This simplification of the world carries all of the usual cautions,
as [Brad and Melissa](http://www.hamiltonproject.org/files/downloads_and_links/MajorDecisions-Appendix_001.pdf)'s explain.

## Another way of thinking about this
It might seem strange that I could make more money by not working and not going
to college than many people would make by working and not going to college.

The difference is that I started with $100,000 and they didn't.
I could spend the money on college and expect a higher salary,
or I could save the money and not work at all.
Either way, I was already set for life.

People stay near the particular economic levels that they start at; in order
to move up economically, you need to get someone to give you money or something
like money, such as a scholarship.

### Other things
Life is more complex, of course. I didn't go to college,
I'd probably still earn more in a job than many other people would because
of various prejudices against people without money and in favor of people
with money.

### Apparent contradictions
This may seem to contradict the findings of the papers I reference; here's
why that happens.

Brad and Melissa's paper doesn't consider what you would do with the money
that you saved by not going to college, while I assume that you are going to
invest it in the stock market.

Michael and Adam's paper considers that you could invest in the stock market,
but it uses different figures for the lifetime earnings. It looks complicated,
and I don't really know what's going on. If you are curious, you can read more
about the figures in
[this article](http://www.econ.ku.dk/okojacob/MAKRO-E05/article-education.pdf).
My hunch is that their use of an average rather than a median will explain the
difference, but, again, I don't really know what's going on.

## Why college might be a good investment
College might be a good investment if either you either pay very little for
it and it gets you into a high-paying industry. In this case, it is interesting
to consider some related investments.

### A scenario
Let's be more precise about what I mean by "very little" and "high-paying".
Suppose you pay $50,000 for college, get a degree in engineering, and then
work in engineering. (It happens that my friend's degree is in engineering.)

If you didn't go to college, your $50,000 might turn into a bit $1 million
(based on our graph).

Our graph suggests that you will make about $2 million in your life if you
go to college instead, which is about $500,000 more.

### Work-related investments
If you choose to go into a high-paying industry, your investment is your
broader preparation for work in that industry. College tuition is a substantial
part of that, but there's more; you have to decide to be in such an industry,
and you probably have to work rather much (both in college and after).

### School-related investments
If you go to a public school, you probably have to work extra hard throughout
your life (mostly during your 20s though) to convince people that you are worth
hiring. This extra work is another substantial investment.

If you manage to pay only $50,000 at a private school, it's probably by
convincing someone else to pay the other $150,000 for you; you might call this
a "scholarship". Applying for scholarships is a large investment because it
is a lot of work. Also, the exact scholarship that you get might limit the
sorts of schooling and work that you can do; this exchange of reduced options
in hope of more pay is another sort of investment.

## Irrelevance of these findings
The present study lumps all different people into the same group, using
figures from two studies that take medians and means, respectively, from
the entire United States. My present results are just as meaningless as
those from any other wacky economic model.

Some specific things that might make my model not relevant to the real
world follow.

* Having lots of savings might make you ineligible for various welfare
    programs.
* The amount of money you earn might depend more on your social class
    than on whether you went to college.
* It might matter where you went to college.
* The cost figure is a mean, and the earnings figure is a median.
    I suspect that the median cost of college is in fact much lower than
    the mean cost of college.
* The model assumes that nobody who doesn't go to college has any savings,
    as this gets factored into the estimates of earnings.

## Conclusion
I think that college can be a good financial investment if you put yourself
in a very special situation, like my friend apparently did. She chose a
field that makes bank and clearly found some way to pay very little for
college. She must have planned very well and generally worked very hard.

Making money is hard because everyone else is trying to too; that's how
capitalism works. I'm now seeing an investing in college to carry the same
sorts of difficulties as those associated with renting out real estate,
starting small businesses, and investing in the stock market.

## Quantitative research as religious texts
The friend just graduated from college. She mentioned that she didn't have
any financial support for college and that she is now earning more in her
entry-level job than her parents ever made.

This is part of a pattern that I see rather often: The biggest advocates for
a thing are usually the people who are hoping that they made the right choice.
